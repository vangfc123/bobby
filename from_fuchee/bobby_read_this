Alright bobby lets start this off ez!

I created a game called hangman, its inside this folder and you can see it by typing ls.

to play the game type: python hangman.py

I want you to play until you win, there are clues I put in there to help you.

If the game ends and you didn't win just restart it again.

When you win then just type in: 
  1. git add .
  2. git commit -m "done"
  3. git push origin master

Good luck bobby!!
