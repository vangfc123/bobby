Bobby I want you to start writing me about something else now, since you have mastered telling me about your day. 

From now on, each day I want you to write me about a new technology subject... I will give you a topic, and I want you to tell me as much as you
can research about it. I don't want you to copy and paste what you find on google, but just tell me a little about what
the technology does ok? Like 4-5 sentences... you can definitely use google for research and talk to people like your teacher for clues. 

Each day just do a google search and tell me about the topic I put down below...
This will help you become a true HaCkeR!

Topic: What is a "white hat hacker"?
