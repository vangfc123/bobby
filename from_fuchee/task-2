In python we can store the words or even numbers in variables like this...

  firstname = "bobby"
  lastname = "vang"

then we can print out this information in a program! Like this...

  print firstname
  print lastname

Your job is to write a program that can store even more information about yourself and then print all that information out.

I started that program for you and even put in some code! Now its
your turn to modify and print out a lot of information about yourself.

you run a program from the command line like this: python myinfo.py
you edit the program like when you do your daily log for me: vim myinfo.py
